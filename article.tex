\title{The Generation of Rank 2 Drinfeld Modular Forms by Eisenstein Series: A Computational Approach}
\author{Liam Baker}
\date{\today}

\begin{document} \maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  A computational method is presented for determining whether or not the space of Drinfeld modular forms for a principal congruence subgroup $\Gamma(N)$ is generated by Eisenstein series, which is currently an open question.
  This method boils down to expressing the dimension of the weight $2$ space generated by Eisenstein series as the rank of a matrix of coefficients of expansions of products of Eisenstein series at the cusps.
  As a result, the question is answered in the case of $q = 2$ and $N$ quadratic or cubic and the case of $q = 3$ and $N$ quadratic.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction and Outline} \label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Outline of the Paper} \label{ssec:outline}

In \cref{sec:intro}, we give an outline of the paper, a review of the work published so far on this specific topic, and a description of the main objects in our playing field.
Then in \cref{sec:algorithm} we describe the algorithm which is the main subject of this paper, together with proof of its validity and bounds on its computational complexity.
In the subsequent \cref{sec:refinements} we present some refinements to the algorithm which speed up its execution; this section also includes some previously unseen relations between Eisenstein series which may even be of interest outside of the context of this algorithm.
Finally in \cref{sec:conclusion} we present the results of the algorithm applied to small values of $N$ and present some concluding remarks.


\subsection{Review of the Relevant Literature} \label{ssec:review}

Drinfeld modules are analogous to elliptic curves in the function field setting, and were first defined by <Drinfeld>, who called them \emph{elliptic modules} and used them to prove <Langlands>.
Later, <Goss> defined what he called \emph{Drinfeld modular forms} of rank $2$ analogously with classical modular forms (in this paper, we will call Drinfeld modular forms simply modular forms, and explicitly mention when their classical counterparts are named).
These functions form a graded algebra graded by their \emph{weight}.
Goss also imposed a condition of `boundedness at infinity' which allowed him to show the finite-dimensionality of the spaces of D-modular forms of any given weight.
<Gekeler> defined Eisenstein series as cases of modular forms, and showed that Eisenstein series of higher weight are generated by Eisenstein series of weight $1$.

The question then naturally arose of whether or not the space of all modular forms is generated as an algebra by the Eisenstein series of weight $1$; this was answered in the affirmative by <Cornellissen> for principal congruence subgroups $\Gamma(N)$ where $N$ is linear, but the question for general $N$ is still open.
The most significant progress thus far has been by <someone>, who showed that the space of all modular forms is generated by the Eisenstein series of weight $1$, possibly together with some cusp forms of weight $2$ (these are modular forms which are zero at all the cusps).
It thus suffices to establish whether or not the Eisenstein series of weight $1$ generates the space of modular forms of weight $2$, and in this paper we give a method for doing so for any specific characteristic $q$ and principal congruence subgroup $\Gamma(N)$, as well as an implementation of this method in SageMath.


\subsection{The Mathematical Setup} \label{ssec:msetup}
Let $q$ be a prime power, and let $\FF_q$ denote the finite field of cardinality $q$.
Let $A = \FF_q[T]$ denote the ring of polynomials with coefficients in $\FF_q$, with $F = \FF_q(T)$ its field of fractions; these can be thought of in analogy with the integers $\ZZ$ and rational numbers $\QQ$ respectively.
$A$ can be equipped with an absolute value $\abs{a} = q^{\deg_T a}$ which is extended to $F$ in the natural way; when $F$ is completed with respect to this absolute value we obtain the field $F_\infty = \FF_q((T))$ of Laurent series in $T$ with finitely many positive powers of $T$, which is analogous to the real numbers $\RR$.
Finally, the completion of an algebraic closure of $F_\infty$ is denoted by $\CCi$; this is analogous to the complex numbers $\CC$, and is where most of the action will happen.

$\CCi$ has rigid analytic structure, as does $\Omega = \CCi - F_\infty$, and as such we can speak of rigid analytic functions on them.
Moreover, the group $\GL[2]{A}$ acts on $\Omega$ on the left by fractional linear transformations $\gamma z = \frac{az+b}{cz+d}$ for $\gamma = \begin{psmallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{psmallmatrix} \in \GL[2]{A}$ and $z \in \CCi$.
That this is a group action can be seen in that it arises from the action of $\GL[2]{A}$ as matrices multiplying on the left of $\PP^2(\CCi)$ with rational lines removed, seen as column vectors: $\begin{psmallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{psmallmatrix} \begin{psmallmatrix} z \\ 1 \end{psmallmatrix} = \begin{psmallmatrix} a z + b \\ c z + d \end{psmallmatrix} = \begin{psmallmatrix} \parens{a z + b}/\parens{c z + d} \\ 1 \end{psmallmatrix}$.
% Indeed, it can be helpful to see $\CCi$ as a subset of $\PP^2(\CCi)$.

As special subgroups of $\GL[2]{A}$ we consider the full congruence subgroups
\[ \Gamma(N) = \ker\parens{\GL[2]{A} \onto \GL[2]{A/N}} = \setst{\gamma \in \GL[2]{A}}{\gamma \equiv \begin{psmallmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{psmallmatrix} \pmod{N}} \]
where $N$ is an ideal of $A$, or equivalently a monic polynomial since $A = \FF_q[T]$ is a principal ideal domain.

The quotient of $\lquotient{\Gamma(N)}{\Omega}$ is compactified by adding finitely many points $\lquotient{\Gamma(N)}{F}$; these points are called the \emph{cusps} of the compactified space, which is denoted by $\overline{M}_{\Gamma(N)}$.

\section{The Algorithm} \label{sec:algorithm}


\section{Refinements To The Algorithm} \label{sec:refinements}


\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

Due to computational constraints we are only able to run the code for some small nonlinear values of $N$, but we hope that this progress will inspire others to improve on our method or given the evidence above to revisit this interesting question with fresh eyes.
